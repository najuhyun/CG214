                <li><b>London City Hall</b></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>As one of the most important buildings raised by Foster + Partners in the past 20 years, the London City Hall was designed with democratic principals in mind.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>As a largely glass structure, the democratic ideals of transparency and accessibility are conveyed in the building’s innovative, oval design. Intended to maximize shading, this building uses about a quarter of the energy consumed by a standard London office building, despite playing host to over 15,000 employees.</li>
                            </ul>

                <li><b>Zayed National Museum</b> </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Zayed National Museum, designed by Lord Norman Foster, tells the story of the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan (1918-2004), and his unification of the United Arab Emirates, the long history of the region and its cultural connections across the world.</li>

                <li><b>Millau Viaduct</b></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bridges are often considered to belong to the realm of the engineer rather than that of the architect. But the architecture of infrastructure has a powerful impact on the environment and the Millau Viaduct, designed in close collaboration with structural engineers, illustrates how the architect can play an integral role in the design of bridges.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Located in southern France, the bridge completes a hitherto missing link in the A75 autoroute from Clermont-Ferrand to Béziers across the Massif Central.</li>
